Once upon a time, Mankind lived side-by-side with the Divines.
For hundreds of years, Divine blessings were given to Mankind, and prayers were given to the Divines.
But the war between Mankind changed their perspective toward the Divines,
casting the blames toward them for all the pain and suffering their fellow man has caused.
Denying the fault of their kind, Mankind proceeded to declare war against the Divines, ruining
the temples they once worshipped, building lies upon lies for their next generations' hatred.
The Divines, with all their wisdom and strength, withstanded the spreading pain and suffering,
believing that one day, perhaps, Mankind would realize their mistake and stopped.

Then they snapped.

Mankind, using the weapons of the Divines, slaughtered one of theirs.
One beloved by all, one who came down to earth to right the misunderstanding, to help Mankind heal
from all the pain and suffering they caused to themselves.
And so The Thirteen Guardian Gods lost one of theirs.
Therefore, after a few years, The Thirteen Guardian Gods accepted their declaration of war, planning to
clear the land from Mankind...
At least, Twelve of them do.
Not too long after the Thirteenth's death, they accepted another to take her place, a kind young god
by the name Noah.
He objected against the other Twelve, and so he was casted away, far from where they hold base,
to the edge of the land he barely know of.

But still, he wanted to put a stop to this plan of theirs.
